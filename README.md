# Let's Get Arrested Number Theoretically!

Forked from [Lets-get-arrested project](https://github.com/hamukazu/lets-get-arrested).
In number theory, whether or not there are any odd perfect numbers is a open problem. `illegal.js` alerts the loop count is not a odd perfect number, while it is not so.

## Description

This script evaluates the loop count's divisors in an ordinary way, and checks if it is a odd perfect number. So, since this is written in JavaScript, if any odd perfect number does not exist, Japanese police of course attack and arrest me!
